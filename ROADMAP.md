# Roadmap

## Current Focus

- [ ] Stable v1.0 release
- [ ] Complete test coverage
- [ ] Documentation improvements
- [ ] Convert to Effect (add helper functions to return types for non-effect consumers)
- [ ] Use effect to convert repositories so they are able to: - yield progress - yield errors
      (warnings) - yield 0, 1 or n results of a specific type - end with fatal errors - succeed with
      metadata (like pagination information)

## Planned

- [ ] More Decap CMS widgets
- [ ] Real-time collaboration
- [ ] GraphQL API option _(under consideration — see [ADR-002](docs/decisions/ADR-002-graphql-api-option.md))_
- [ ] Capability sharing - bubble capabilities up through the chain of repositories; propagate
      capabilities via documents-api, storage-api, and assets-api to be read via proxy packages.
      _Note: Not currently necessary since Decap doesn't support paging, so everything is downloaded
      locally and capabilities like search can be done client-side. However, this is vital for
      supporting bigger datasets in the future._

## Completed

- [x] Core architecture
- [x] Cloudflare R2 support
- [x] Decap CMS backend
- [x] OAuth2 with PKCE
- [x] File sanitization
- [x] Editorial workflow
- [x] Netlify git-gateway compatible HTTP handler (`@laikacms/git-gateway`) — lets Decap CMS
      configured with `backend: git-gateway` point at a Laika worker without changing client config
- [x] Hosted multi-tenant gateway app (`apps/laika-gateway`) — one GitHub App that anyone can
      install on their repo; tenants point Decap at the gateway URL
      (`/github/{owner}/{repo}/api/decap`) instead of standing up their own Worker. Namespaced URL
      scheme leaves room for `/gitlab/...` etc. later.
- [x] WebDAV storage implementation (`laikacms/storage-webdav`) — runtime-agnostic
      `StorageRepository` backed by any RFC 4918 WebDAV server (Nextcloud, ownCloud, Apache
      `mod_dav`, `rclone serve webdav`). Only depends on `fetch`, so it runs on Node, Bun, Deno,
      Cloudflare Workers, and the browser.
- [x] S3 storage implementation (`@laikacms/aws/storage-s3`) — AWS SDK v3 `S3Client`-backed
      `StorageRepository`, parallels `storage-r2`. Works against AWS S3, MinIO, LocalStack,
      Backblaze B2, Wasabi, DigitalOcean Spaces — anything that speaks the S3 API.
- [x] MeiliSearch storage implementation (`@laikacms/meilisearch/storage-meilisearch`) —
      `StorageRepository` over a single [MeiliSearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/) index. Five
      architectural traits distinguish it from Algolia (iter 11) and every other prior backend: (1)
      **async-by-default mutations via the Tasks API** — every PUT / DELETE / POST mutation returns
      `{taskUid, status:
      'enqueued'}`; the data source automatically polls
      `GET
      /tasks/{uid}` until terminal status. **First backend with this
      async-write-with-polling pattern**; (2) **`POST /indexes/{uid}/documents/delete-batch`** with
      primary-key array body — returns ONE task uid; the whole batch commits atomically once the
      task succeeds. **The 16th structurally distinct atomic-multi-write mechanism in the suite**:
      async-bulk-operation completed via task polling; (3) **SQL-like filter syntax** —
      `parent = "notes" AND type =
      "file"` (vs Algolia's Lucene-style
      `parent:"notes" AND type:"file"`); (4) **documents have a `primaryKey` declared at index
      creation** — the repository configures `id` as primary key with values like
      `file:notes/hello.md`; (5) **search via POST body** — `POST /indexes/{uid}/search` with
      `{filter, q, limit}` in JSON body, NOT URL query parameters. Index auto-created on first use
      with the right primary key and filterable attributes.
- [x] Backblaze B2 native storage implementation (`@laikacms/backblaze/storage-b2`) —
      `StorageRepository` backed by [Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage) via the
      **native API** (not the S3-compatible mode — that's covered by `@laikacms/aws/storage-s3`).
      Five wire-format traits distinguish it from every prior backend, including every S3-shaped
      object store already in the suite: (1) **two-phase upload pattern** — every upload requires a
      separate `b2_get_upload_url` call first, returning a fresh `uploadUrl` +
      `uploadAuthorizationToken` pair; subsequent `b2_upload_file` POSTs to _that_ URL with _that_
      token, on a different endpoint and different lifecycle. **First backend with this auth
      pattern**; (2) **file versioning by default** — every upload creates a new version; deletes
      need the `(fileName, fileId)` tuple, not just the name. Distinct from S3-style
      overwrite-in-place; (3) **mandatory SHA-1 content verification** — uploads MUST include
      `X-Bz-Content-Sha1` header matching the actual content; B2 rejects mismatches at the storage
      layer. **First backend with mandatory content-hash verification on writes**. Hash computed via
      Web Crypto (`computeSha1Hex` helper exported); (4) **bare `Authorization: <token>` header**
      (no `Bearer`, no `Token`, no `Basic`). Distinct from every other auth header convention in the
      suite; (5) **POST-for-everything API** — even reads of metadata use POST with a JSON body.
      First backend with this convention. Account auth and upload URLs are cached automatically
      (~23h lifetime); re-acquisition on 503. `removeAtoms(N)` does N parallel
      `b2_delete_file_version` calls — B2 has no bulk-delete endpoint; not a new atomic-multi-write
      mechanism.
- [x] InfluxDB v2 storage implementation (`@laikacms/influxdb/storage-influxdb`) —
      `StorageRepository` backed by [InfluxDB v2](https://www.influxdata.com/) via the HTTP API.
      **First time-series backend in the suite.** Six wire-format traits distinguish it from every
      prior backend: (1) **line protocol writes** — newline-delimited textual format
      `measurement,tag=v field="v" timestamp_ns`. **First textual line-by-line write format in the
      suite**; (2) **Flux pipeline DSL for reads** — functional `|>`-piped expressions
      (`from(...) |> filter(...) |> last() |> pivot(...)`). **First functional pipeline DSL in the
      suite** — Cypher uses pattern-matching, EdgeQL/SurrealDB use shape literals, SQL-likes use
      SELECT/INSERT; Flux is structurally different — closer to LINQ or `xargs`; (3) **annotated CSV
      responses** — `#datatype` / `#group` / `#default` header rows precede the column-name header.
      **First CSV-on-the-wire backend**; (4) **tags vs fields distinction** — tags are indexed
      strings (used in filters & delete predicates); fields are arbitrary values. **First
      indexed/unindexed column distinction in the suite**; (5) **nanosecond timestamps** —
      `Date.now() * 1_000_000` precision in line protocol writes; surfaces as `revisionId` on reads.
      **First backend where `revisionId` is a sub-millisecond timestamp**; (6)
      **`Authorization: Token <token>` header** (literally the word `Token`, NOT `Bearer`). Distinct
      from every other auth header convention. Honest about the time-series shape being unusual for
      CMS — append-only storage with `|> last()` dedup semantics. `removeAtoms(N)` does N parallel
      `/api/v2/delete` calls (Influx v2's predicate language only supports `=` equality between
      AND'd clauses); not a new atomic-multi-write mechanism.
- [x] Convex storage implementation (`@laikacms/convex/storage-convex`) — `StorageRepository` backed
      by [Convex](https://convex.dev) via the HTTP RPC endpoint. **First "platform-as-API" backend**
      — the "query language" is server-side TypeScript functions defined in the user's Convex
      project; the package's value is the wire-shape adapter and the standardised function-contract.
      Five architectural traits distinguish it from every prior backend: (1) **named-function RPC as
      the query primitive** — wire shape is `POST /api/{query,mutation}` with
      `{path: "laika:getFile",
      args: {...}}` body. The function name travels in the body, not
      the URL. **First backend without a query DSL** (SQL/Mango/ Cypher/etc.) — TypeScript on the
      Convex side IS the DSL; (2) **`{status: "success", value}` envelope** wrapping every response.
      **First backend with explicit success/error discriminator at the envelope level** (not just
      HTTP status); (3) **query / mutation / action triad** — Convex distinguishes pure reads,
      transactional writes, and side-effects at the endpoint level. **First backend with this
      read/write/side-effect distinction**; (4) **transactional mutations** — each mutation call
      runs as one transaction. `removeAtoms(N)` ships as ONE mutation call (`laika:removeFiles`)
      with the full path array; the user's function deletes N rows inside one transaction. Atomicity
      at the user-defined function boundary, not a new wire protocol mechanism — honest framing; (5)
      **per-deployment URL** — each Convex deployment is its own hostname; no database name in the
      URL. The package ships with a reference Convex module (`convex/laika.ts`) in the README that
      users copy into their project; function paths are configurable for custom layouts.
- [x] Trello storage implementation (`@laikacms/trello/storage-trello`) — `StorageRepository` over a
      single [Trello](https://trello.com) board. **First Kanban-style backend** in the suite —
      boards contain lists contain cards, and Markdown `desc` fields hold content. Five
      architectural traits distinguish it from every prior backend: (1) **floating-point `pos`
      ordering** — every card carries a positive-float `pos` field server-assigned for drag-and-drop
      ordering. **First backend with native positional ordering at the wire level**; (2)
      **`?key=…&token=…` URL-parameter authentication** — auth via query string, not headers.
      **First backend with query-string-based auth**; (3) **type-specific soft/hard delete** — lists
      are soft-deleted via `closed=true` (no physical-delete endpoint exists for lists); cards are
      physically deletable. **First backend with two different deletion lifecycles per resource
      type**; (4) **2-level platform hierarchy flattened to N-level paths** — deep paths encode into
      list names (`notes/sub/deep` → list `"notes/sub"` containing card `"deep.md"`); root-level
      files go to a synthesised `__root__` list. **First backend that flattens an arbitrary tree
      into a depth-limited platform**; (5) **`dateLastActivity` as the server-managed revision** —
      Trello updates this timestamp on every card mutation; surfaces as `metadata.revisionId`.
      **First backend using a server-managed change timestamp as the revision identifier**. Honest
      about what's _not_ here: Trello has no bulk-delete endpoint, so `removeAtoms(N)` does N
      parallel `DELETE
      /1/cards/:id` calls — not a new atomic-multi-write mechanism.
- [x] ClickHouse storage implementation (`@laikacms/clickhouse/storage-clickhouse`) —
      `StorageRepository` backed by [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) via the HTTP interface.
      **First columnar OLAP backend** in the suite. Works against self-hosted ClickHouse, ClickHouse
      Cloud, and ClickHouse-compatible analytics engines. Four architectural traits distinguish it
      from prior SQL-ish backends: (1) **streaming NDJSON wire format** — `FORMAT JSONEachRow`
      returns newline-delimited JSON one row per line; INSERTs accept the same format in the request
      body. **First backend with streaming row-at-a-time wire format**; (2) **URL-as-query** — SQL
      travels in the URL as `?query=…`, NOT the body. Body is reserved for INSERT NDJSON data.
      **First backend where SQL and payload occupy different parts of the wire envelope**; (3)
      **`ReplacingMergeTree(version)` upsert semantics** — writes are INSERTs with monotonic version
      columns; duplicate rows are deduped on background merges. No conditional INSERT-or-UPDATE
      needed at the application layer (in contrast to every prior SQL backend's `ON CONFLICT` /
      `UPSERT` / `UNLESS CONFLICT` idiom); (4) **`FINAL` read modifier** — every SELECT uses `FINAL`
      to force merge-on-read for latest-version visibility. **First backend with explicit
      consistency-vs-performance read modifiers.** Honest about what's _not_ here: `removeAtoms(N)`
      ships as `DELETE FROM … WHERE path IN (…) SETTINGS
      mutations_sync = 1` — same shape as
      Supabase PostgREST (iter 24); not a new atomic-multi-write mechanism. The novelty is in the
      wire format and engine semantics, not in multi-write atomicity.
- [x] Gel (formerly EdgeDB) storage implementation (`@laikacms/gel/storage-gel`) —
      `StorageRepository` backed by [Gel](https://gel.com) (formerly [EdgeDB](https://edgedb.com))
      via the HTTP EdgeQL endpoint. Five architectural traits distinguish it from every prior
      backend in the suite: (1) **EdgeQL object-shape literals** —
      `INSERT LaikaFile { path
      := <str>$path }` (note `:=` for assignment, `=` for equality).
      First backend with this assignment/comparison distinction at the wire level; (2)
      **`<type>$param` typed parameter casts** — every parameter declares its type in the query text
      itself (`<str>$path`, `<array<str>>$paths`), propagating to the backend planner. Different
      from libSQL's typed-object wire format and SurrealDB's bare `$name`; (3)
      **`FOR x IN ... UNION ( ... )` for atomic batching** — `removeAtoms(N)` ships as ONE
      `FOR p IN
      array_unpack(<array<str>>$paths) UNION (DELETE LaikaFile FILTER
      .path = p)`
      query. Single statement, one transaction. **The 15th structurally distinct atomic-multi-write
      mechanism**; (4) **`UNLESS CONFLICT ON .property ELSE ( ... )`** — EdgeQL's
      UPSERT-with-fallback idiom, distinct from MERGE (Cypher/SurrealDB), ON CONFLICT
      (libSQL/Postgres), and CAS-based mechanisms (etcd / AT Protocol). The ELSE branch runs as the
      alternate action when the conflict fires; (5) **object types with links** — schema-first
      object-relational model; first object-relational backend in the suite. Type and module
      identifiers (which EdgeQL can't parameterise) are validated against a strict regex to prevent
      injection at the configuration layer.
- [x] Neo4j storage implementation (`@laikacms/neo4j/storage-neo4j`) — `StorageRepository` over
      [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) via the transactional HTTP endpoint (`POST /db/{db}/tx/commit`).
      Works against self-hosted Neo4j, AuraDB, and any HTTP-compatible Cypher endpoint. Five
      architectural traits distinguish it from every prior backend — including SurrealDB
      (graph-capable but not graph-native): (1) **Cypher pattern-matching DSL** — `(f:LaikaFile)`,
      `(child)-[:CHILD_OF]->(parent)` syntax with arrow-direction semantics; (2) **graph
      relationships as the hierarchy primitive** — files link to folders via `[:CHILD_OF]` edges,
      and folder listings are pattern-match traversals (`<-[:CHILD_OF]-(c)`). **First backend using
      graph traversal as a listing primitive**; (3) **`DETACH DELETE`** — removes node + all
      relationships in one statement; first cascading-delete primitive in the suite; (4)
      **`POST /tx/commit` with `{statements: [...]}`** — implicit transaction boundary at the
      endpoint (no `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` keywords like SurrealDB). `removeAtoms(N)` ships as one
      tx/commit body with N DETACH DELETE statements. **The 14th structurally distinct
      atomic-multi-write mechanism**; (5) **node label discrimination** — `:LaikaFile` /
      `:LaikaFolder` as first-class label tags, not `type` properties. Cypher injection guards on
      configured labels (PascalCase) and relationship types (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE) since labels aren't
      parameterisable in Cypher syntax.
- [x] Solid Pod / Linked Data Platform storage implementation (`@laikacms/solid/storage-solid`) —
      `StorageRepository` over a [Solid Pod](https://solidproject.org/) / LDP-compatible server
      (CommunitySolidServer, Inrupt's Enterprise Solid Server, Apache Jena Fuseki, etc.). Ships with
      a focused Turtle parser for the LDP container-listing format — no external RDF library needed.
      Five architectural traits set it apart from every prior backend: (1) **URI-as-identity** —
      every resource IS its URL (`https://alice.pod.example/laika/notes/hello.md`); no opaque ids,
      no `(table, id)` tuples; (2) **trailing-slash addressing** — `<pod>/notes/` (with `/`) is an
      LDP container, `<pod>/notes.md` (without) is a resource. The URL itself disambiguates file vs
      folder. First backend with this convention; (3) **RDF/Turtle wire format for container
      listings** — `GET
      <container/>` with `Accept: text/turtle` returns a Turtle document
      whose `ldp:contains` triples enumerate the children. **First triple-store / Linked Data
      backend in the suite**; (4) **content negotiation via `Accept` headers** — different formats
      per resource type (`text/markdown` for `.md`, `application/json` for `.json`, `text/turtle`
      for container metadata). **First content-negotiation backend**; (5) **`If-None-Match: *` for
      create-only PUTs** — HTTP precondition semantics as the OCC primitive (412 Precondition Failed
      → `EntryAlreadyExistsError`). First backend using HTTP preconditions for OCC. Honest about
      what's _not_ here: LDP has no native bulk-delete primitive, so `removeAtoms(N)` does N
      parallel DELETEs. Ancestor containers are auto-created since LDP requires parent containers to
      exist before adding children.
- [x] LDAP storage implementation (`@laikacms/ldap/storage-ldap`) — `StorageRepository` over an LDAP
      directory. **Client-agnostic** — depends on a structural `LdapOps` interface (just five
      methods: `search`, `add`, `modify`, `del`, `bulkOps`) rather than any specific LDAP library,
      so it works with `ldapjs`, DSMLv2/HTTP gateways, or hand-rolled mocks. Five architectural
      traits distinguish it from every prior backend: (1) **DN-based hierarchical addressing** —
      right-to-left RDN order (`cn=hello.md,ou=notes,ou=cms,dc=example,dc=com`); the DN encodes the
      full path. **First backend with this addressing model**; (2) **`objectClass` schema model** —
      entries declare their type(s) as a multi-valued attribute (`laikaFile` / `laikaFolder` on top
      of `top` + `organizationalUnit`); (3) **LDAP search filter DSL** —
      `(&(objectClass=laikaFile)(|(cn=k.md)(cn=k.json)…))` for extension-free key resolution in
      **one** search call; filter values are escaped per RFC 4515 (`*` → `\2a`, `(` → `\28`, etc.)
      to prevent LDAP injection via filenames; (4) **scope-based searches** — `one`-scope against
      the parent OU gives server-side immediate-child listings (no client-side prefix scan needed);
      (5) **`bulkOps` as the atomic-multi-write primitive** — `removeAtoms(N)` ships as one bulkOps
      call with N `del` actions. **The 13th structurally distinct atomic-multi-write mechanism**.
      Ancestor OUs are auto-created when needed since LDAP requires parent entries to exist before
      adding children. The repository uses `organizationalUnit` as the canonical container class
      with the auxiliary `laikaFolder` so it can recognise its own folders vs other LDAP OUs.
- [x] SurrealDB storage implementation (`@laikacms/surrealdb/storage-surrealdb`) —
      `StorageRepository` backed by [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/), a multi-model database
      (documents + graph + KV + relational). Four architectural traits set it apart from prior
      SQL-ish backends: (1) **`table:id` record identity** — record IDs are first-class composite
      handles, with safe construction via `type::thing("table", $path)`. Paths with slashes, dots,
      or any special characters bind without manual escaping; (2) **NS / DB header isolation** —
      namespace and database scoped via `NS:` / `DB:` HTTP request headers, not URL paths or query
      strings. **First backend in the suite with header-based tenancy**; (3)
      **`BEGIN TRANSACTION; …; COMMIT TRANSACTION;` as the atomic primitive** — semicolon-delimited
      SurQL statements wrapped in an explicit transaction and posted to `/sql` in a single body.
      `removeAtoms(N)` packs into one such transaction. The 12th structurally distinct
      atomic-multi-write mechanism; (4) **per-statement result envelopes** — every `POST /sql`
      returns an array of `{status, time, result}` entries, one per statement. The data source's
      `transaction()` helper namespaces variables per-statement (`$path` → `$path_0`, `$path_1`, …)
      to avoid collision in SurrealDB's global query-string vars. Two-table model: `laika_file` and
      `laika_folder`.
- [x] AT Protocol storage implementation (`@laikacms/atproto/storage-atproto`) — `StorageRepository`
      over an [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/) repo on a PDS (Personal Data Server). Works
      against Bluesky's hosted PDS, self-hosted `pds`, and any AT Protocol-compatible host. Three
      architectural traits set it apart from everything before: (1) **DID-based repo identity** —
      the entire repo _is_ a DID like `did:plc:abc...`; no "database name", no "bucket id";
      multi-tenancy is intrinsic. URIs use the `at://<did>/<collection>/<rkey>` scheme; (2)
      **content-addressable records** — every record carries a CID (SHA-256-based hash of the
      canonicalised CBOR encoding) that surfaces as `metadata.revisionId`. **First
      content-addressable backend in the suite** (all prior `revisionId` values were monotonic
      counters, ETags, or document revs — none were content hashes). Updates use the prior CID as
      `swapRecord` for CAS; (3) **`applyWrites` with discriminated-union actions** — the atomic
      multi-record write primitive takes an array tagged with
      `$type: 'com.atproto.repo.applyWrites#{create|update|delete}'`. `removeAtoms(N)` ships as one
      `applyWrites` call with N `#delete` actions — the 11th structurally distinct
      atomic-multi-write mechanism. rkey range scans via `[rkeyStart, rkeyEnd)` for prefix listing —
      same idiom as etcd, on the rkey alphabet. Two-collection model: `com.laikacms.file` and
      `com.laikacms.folder`.
- [x] Microsoft Graph / OneDrive storage implementation (`@laikacms/microsoft/storage-onedrive`) —
      `StorageRepository` backed by a OneDrive personal drive, OneDrive for Business, or a
      SharePoint document library via the
      [Microsoft Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/) API. Three architectural traits
      distinguish it from the rest: (1) **native path addressing** via the `/me/drive/root:/path:`
      colon-segment URL syntax — no opaque-id lookup step, and folder hierarchy is the real
      server-side structure of the drive; (2) **`POST /$batch` as the bulk endpoint** — up to 20
      mixed-method requests in one HTTP round-trip with optional `dependsOn` sequencing;
      `removeAtoms(N)` ships as one `$batch` with N `DELETE` sub-requests (chunked at 20). **The 9th
      structurally distinct atomic-multi-write mechanism in the suite**; (3) **pre-signed
      `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl`** in metadata — every file response carries a short-lived
      public URL, so `getObject` does one authenticated metadata fetch + one unauthenticated CDN
      content fetch. First backend in the suite with **per-write conflict policy** at the API level
      (`@microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior` = `fail` / `replace` / `rename`).
- [x] libSQL / Turso storage implementation (`@laikacms/libsql/storage-libsql`) —
      `StorageRepository` backed by libSQL via the hrana HTTP pipeline protocol. Speaks to Turso
      Cloud, Fly libSQL, and self-hosted `sqld`. Distinct from the Cloudflare D1 implementation
      (also SQLite-over-HTTP) in two structural ways: (1) **the wire shape is `POST /v2/pipeline`**
      carrying N requests per HTTP round-trip (vs D1's one-statement `/query`); (2) **arguments are
      typed wire objects** — `{type: "text", value: "..."}` / `{type: "null"}` /
      `{type: "integer", value: "42"}` — not bare positional `?` params. Combined: `removeAtoms(N)`
      ships as **one** atomic `batch` request with N conditional `DELETE` steps (each
      `condition: {type: 'ok', step: prev}`), the **8th structurally distinct atomic-multi-write
      mechanism** in the suite. The whole batch rolls back if any step fails.
- [x] etcd storage implementation (`@laikacms/etcd/storage-etcd`) — `StorageRepository` backed by an
      [etcd](https://etcd.io/) v3 cluster via the gRPC JSON gateway. Three architectural traits
      distinguish it from everything before: (1) **base64-encoded keys/values on the wire** — etcd's
      JSON gateway requires `key`/`value` fields to be base64 (the gateway rejects raw strings with
      an opaque error); first backend in the suite with a binary-wire-format encoding step; (2)
      **prefix scans via `[key, range_end)` pairs** — no `?prefix=` parameter, you compute
      `range_end` by incrementing the last byte of `prefix` (`/notes/` → `/notes0`); the canonical
      etcd idiom, exposed by `prefixRangeEnd()` for app code; (3) **`Txn` as the atomic primitive**
      — `createObject` uses CAS (`compare: createRevision == 0` + `success: [requestPut]`),
      `removeAtoms(N)` packs N `requestDeleteRange` ops into one `Txn.success` array (7th
      structurally distinct atomic-multi-write mechanism in the suite). Real MVCC revisions
      (`mod_revision`) surface as `metadata.revisionId`. Key layout encodes type as a path segment
      (`/f/` vs `/d/`) so files and folders never collide.
- [x] MongoDB storage implementation (`@laikacms/mongodb/storage-mongodb`) — `StorageRepository`
      over a single MongoDB collection. **Driver-agnostic** — depends on a structural
      `MongoCollectionLike` interface (just six methods) rather than the official `mongodb` driver,
      so it works with any client (native driver, Atlas Data API shim, hand-rolled mock).
      Distinguishing trait: **aggregation pipeline as the listing DSL** —
      `aggregate([{$match: {parent}}, {$sort: {name:1}}, {$project:
      {content: 0}}])`. The
      `$project: {content: 0}` stage is load-bearing — strips the heavy body field from listings,
      the first backend to do this server-side. First staged-transformation query language in the
      suite (every prior DSL was a single selector expression or boolean predicate tree).
      `removeAtoms(N)` packs into one `deleteMany({_id: {$in: [...]}})`, atomic at the collection
      boundary regardless of N.
- [x] Apache CouchDB storage implementation (`@laikacms/couchdb/storage-couchdb`) —
      `StorageRepository` backed by [Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) (also speaks to
      IBM Cloudant and any CouchDB-protocol-compatible store). Three traits distinguish it from
      everything before: (1) **first-class revisions** — every doc carries `_rev`, updates require
      the current rev, stale writes return a real 409 (the first true OCC mechanic in the suite);
      (2) **Mango selectors** as the query DSL — JSON-encoded
      `{selector: {parent: 'notes', type: 'file'}}` with `$or`/`$and`/`$in` support; (3)
      `POST /_bulk_docs` for atomic multi-document writes — `removeAtoms(N)` is **two** round-trips
      regardless of N (one `_find`, one `_bulk_docs`), with per-doc conflict reporting in the
      response array. Doc-shape: files at `<key>.<ext>`, folders at `<key>`, both with `parent` /
      `name` / `type` fields for efficient listing.
- [x] Vercel Blob storage implementation (`@laikacms/vercel/storage-blob`) — `StorageRepository`
      backed by [Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob). Two architectural quirks
      distinguish it from the S3/R2 line: (1) deletes go through `POST /delete` with URLs in the
      _body_, not `DELETE /<key>`, so `removeAtoms(N)` packs into **one** round-trip regardless of
      N; (2) Vercel's list endpoint has no `delimiter` parameter, so subfolder grouping is
      reconstructed client-side by partitioning each path's tail on `/`. `addRandomSuffix=0` is
      hard-coded on every upload so key→URL is deterministic. Runtime-agnostic — only depends on
      `fetch`.
- [x] Supabase (PostgREST) storage implementation (`@laikacms/supabase/storage-postgrest`) —
      `StorageRepository` backed by Supabase's auto-generated PostgREST API. Postgres-over-HTTP with
      PostgREST's operator-suffix filter DSL (`?Parent=eq.notes&Type=eq.file`,
      `?or=(Name.eq.a,Name.eq.b)`). `removeAtoms(N)` packs into a single `Path=in.(…)` DELETE — one
      round-trip regardless of N. Test mock ships a faithful evaluator for the filter subset. Same
      data source talks to self-hosted PostgREST too.
- [x] Cloudflare Images assets implementation (`@laikacms/cloudflare/assets-cf-images`) —
      `AssetsRepository` backed by Cloudflare Images. Sits alongside the existing `storage-d1` in
      the same package — **second dual-contract package** in the suite (after `@laikacms/aws`).
      Variants are configured **account-level** (not per-URL like Cloudinary's transforms) — the
      repository emits one delivery URL per configured variant name via the
      `imagedelivery.net/<accountHash>/<imageId>/<variant>` pattern. Cloudflare Images has no native
      folders, so the repository synthesises folder hierarchy from `/` in image ids and filters
      listings client-side after a full enumeration.
- [x] Airtable storage implementation (`@laikacms/airtable/storage-airtable`) — `StorageRepository`
      backed by an Airtable table. Reads use `filterByFormula` (Airtable's own DSL with `{Field}`
      braces and double-doubled `""` literal escaping). Writes chunk transparently around Airtable's
      10-record batch cap — `removeAtoms(25)` ships as ⌈25/10⌉ = 3 DELETE calls. Test mock ships a
      recursive-descent parser for the formula subset so new query shapes surface as parser
      failures, not silent regressions.
- [x] Pinata (IPFS) storage implementation (`@laikacms/pinata/storage-ipfs`) — `StorageRepository`
      backed by IPFS via Pinata. **The first content-addressed backend** in the suite — CIDs are
      content hashes, so updates are inherently copy-on-write: pin new content (new CID) → unpin
      old. The mutable storage contract sits on top of Pinata's pin-metadata search
      (`metadata[name]` and `metadata[keyvalues]` operator filters). Test suite includes an explicit
      simulation of the post-update window where the search index shows both old and new CIDs,
      verifying the newest-by-`date_pinned` selection.
- [x] GitHub Gist storage implementation (`@laikacms/gist/storage-gist`) — `StorageRepository`
      backed by a single GitHub Gist. Every storage operation routes through one `PATCH /gists/{id}`
      call with the full file delta — so `removeAtoms(['a','b','c'])` becomes **one** atomic PATCH,
      not three sequential calls. Slashes in keys encode as `__` (GitHub forbids `/` in gist
      filenames); the `encodeGistFilename` / `decodeGistFilename` helpers are exported.
- [x] Hygraph storage implementation (`@laikacms/hygraph/storage-hygraph`) — `StorageRepository`
      backed by Hygraph (formerly GraphCMS) via the GraphQL Content API. **First true-GraphQL
      transport** in the suite — Sanity uses GROQ, this is standard GraphQL. Lists both files and
      folders in **one** GraphQL operation by asking for two top-level fields (`laikaObjects` +
      `laikaFolders`) in the same request — only possible because GraphQL lets a single query
      traverse multiple schema roots. Assumes `LaikaObject` + `LaikaFolder` content models exist on
      the project.
- [x] PocketBase storage implementation (`@laikacms/pocketbase/storage-pb`) — `StorageRepository`
      backed by [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io). **First self-hostable open-source backend** in
      the suite; SQLite under the hood, REST + JWT on the wire, PocketBase's own filter
      mini-language for queries. Records live in a configurable collection (default
      `laika_storage`); the repository expects the schema to be provisioned ahead of time. Test
      suite includes a recursive-descent parser for the filter language to pin the exact query
      shapes the repository emits.
- [x] Sanity storage implementation (`@laikacms/sanity/storage-sanity`) — `StorageRepository` backed
      by Sanity via the Content Lake HTTP API. GROQ for reads, **transactional `/mutate`** for
      writes — deep keys + ancestor folder markers commit atomically in one HTTP request, different
      from every other backend in the suite which writes ancestor markers separately. Native
      optimistic concurrency via Sanity's `_rev`, surfaced as `metadata.revisionId` and
      round-tripped on `updateObject` as `ifRevisionID`.
- [x] S3 assets implementation (`@laikacms/aws/assets-s3`) — **second contract layered on the same
      `S3Client`** used by `@laikacms/aws/storage-s3`. Same bucket model, same auth, different Laika
      contract — pair them on one bucket (separated by `basePath`) for combined content storage +
      asset hosting from a single AWS resource. Variations are pure URL transforms (CloudFront /
      Lambda@Edge / custom CDN), zero round-trips. First demonstration of dual-contract support on
      one backend.
- [x] Cloudflare D1 storage implementation (`@laikacms/cloudflare/storage-d1`) — `StorageRepository`
      backed by Cloudflare D1 (managed SQLite) over its HTTP REST API. SQL at the edge, runs
      everywhere `fetch` runs. Caller provisions the schema via the exported `schemaDdl()` helper.
      Single-`LIKE` extension probe resolves extension-free keys in one indexed query, in contrast
      to the parallel-`EXISTS` fan-out other DB-backed backends use.
- [x] Bitbucket storage implementation (`@laikacms/bitbucket/storage-bb`) — `StorageRepository`
      backed by Bitbucket Cloud via the REST v2 API. App-password or OAuth2 auth. Closes the
      git-platform triumvirate alongside `@laikacms/github` and `@laikacms/gitlab`. All writes
      (creates, updates, deletes) go through Bitbucket's unified `POST /src` multipart commit
      endpoint, so the underlying data source exposes a `commit({puts, deletes})` call for atomic
      multi-file commits.
- [x] Firestore storage implementation (`@laikacms/firestore/storage-firestore`) — a
      `StorageRepository` backed by Firebase Firestore via the REST API. Walks Laika's `/`-separated
      keys onto Firestore's alternating `collection/document/collection/document` scheme: every path
      segment becomes a document, every folder owns an `items` subcollection. Listing a folder is
      one native subcollection `GET`, no prefix scan. Path segments are constrained to
      `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$` and rejected upfront with a clear error otherwise.
- [x] Notion storage implementation (`@laikacms/notion/storage-notion`) — a `StorageRepository`
      backed by Notion. Page hierarchy maps to storage hierarchy: pages with child pages are
      folders, leaf pages are objects, paragraph-block body is the object content. Instance-local
      path → page-id cache so repeat lookups don't re-walk. Honest about the trade-offs: empty
      folders aren't visible, plain- text body only, no native version counter.
- [x] Algolia storage implementation (`@laikacms/algolia/storage-algolia`) — a `StorageRepository`
      backed by an Algolia search index. Each record carries reserved `_type`, `_parent`,
      `_extension`, `_content` attributes so listing a folder becomes one filtered query
      (`filters=_parent:"<folder>"`) rather than a prefix scan — the single-query folder lookup is
      unique among the storage backends so far. Writes are immediately searchable through the same
      index.
- [x] Cloudinary assets implementation (`@laikacms/cloudinary/assets-cloudinary`) — the suite's
      first non-storage backend; implements `AssetsRepository`. Signed uploads via Web Crypto
      (`api_secret` never leaves the server), Admin API for metadata + folder ops, deterministic URL
      transforms make `getVariations` zero-cost (no API call per variant). Six default variations
      (thumbnail/small/medium/large/webp/avif) or a caller-supplied set. Runtime-agnostic.
- [x] Azure Blob Storage implementation (`@laikacms/azure/storage-blob`) — `StorageRepository` over
      Azure Blob Storage. Mirrors `@laikacms/aws/storage-s3` in shape (flat container, simulated
      `/`-delimited folders, `.keep` markers, ETag surfaced as `metadata.revisionId`) but consumes a
      small `BlobOps` interface fronted by the Azure SDK via `azureContainerOps()` — so tests can
      drive the repository from a plain object literal. Completes the AWS / GCP / Azure
      cloud-storage trio.
- [x] Contentful storage implementation (`@laikacms/contentful/storage-contentful`) —
      `StorageRepository` backed by Contentful via the Content Management API. Two-level mapping
      (`<contentTypeId>/<entryId>`); no extension hiding because Contentful stores structured field
      values, not blobs. Native optimistic concurrency via `sys.version` exposed as
      `metadata.revisionId`. `createFolder` idempotently creates and activates a content type.
      Runtime-agnostic.
- [x] Dropbox storage implementation (`@laikacms/dropbox/storage-dropbox`) — `StorageRepository`
      backed by Dropbox via the HTTP API v2. Path-addressed (no id walk like Drive), real folders,
      first-class optimistic concurrency via Dropbox `rev` exposed as `metadata.revisionId`.
      Static-token or async `tokenProvider` auth. Runtime-agnostic.
- [x] Upstash Redis storage implementation (`@laikacms/upstash/storage-redis`) — `StorageRepository`
      backed by Redis via the Upstash REST API. Edge-friendly (only depends on `fetch`); pipelined
      `EXISTS` probe resolves an extension-free key in a single round-trip regardless of how many
      serializers are registered. Useful as a cache-tier in front of S3/DDB or as standalone storage
      for edge-only deployments.
- [x] Google Drive storage implementation (`@laikacms/google/storage-drive`) — Drive REST v3 backed
      `StorageRepository`. Real Drive folders (no `.keep` placeholders), instance-local path → id
      cache, static-token or async `tokenProvider` auth. Runtime-agnostic — only depends on `fetch`.
      First export of a new `@laikacms/google` workspace package.
- [x] DynamoDB storage implementation (`@laikacms/aws/storage-ddb`) — `StorageRepository` over a
      single DynamoDB table. `PK` partitions by parent folder, `SK` is the basename; listing a
      folder is one `Query`, finding a file by extension-free key is one `Query` with
      `begins_with(SK, "<base>.")`. Configurable `partitionPrefix` for multi-tenant deployments.
- [x] GitLab storage implementation (`@laikacms/gitlab`) — REST v4 backed `StorageRepository`
      paralleling `@laikacms/github`. PAT / OAuth / CI-job-token auth, optimistic concurrency via
      `last_commit_id`, upsert via `POST` → `PUT` fallback. Reserves the gateway's
      `/gitlab/{owner}/{repo}/...` URL prefix. Runtime-agnostic.
