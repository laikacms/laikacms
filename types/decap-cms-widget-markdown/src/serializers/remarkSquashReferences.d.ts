/**
 * Raw markdown may contain image references or link references. Because there
 * is no way to maintain these references within the Slate AST, we convert image
 * and link references to standard images and links by putting their url's
 * inline. The definitions are then removed from the document.
 *
 * For example, the following markdown:
 *
 * ```
 * ![alpha][bravo]
 *
 * [bravo]: http://example.com/example.jpg
 * ```
 *
 * Yields:
 *
 * ```
 * ![alpha](http://example.com/example.jpg)
 * ```
